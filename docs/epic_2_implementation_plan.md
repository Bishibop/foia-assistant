2. **Testing**: Comprehensive testing (39 tests) was crucial for ensuring data isolation works correctly
3. **UI Design**: Adding RequestDetailsPanel improved user experience significantly
4. **Model Extensions**: FOIARequest needed additional methods (get_summary, get_progress_percentage) beyond initial design
5. **Integration**: The modular design will facilitate easier integration with existing tabs

### Day 2 Insights
1. **UI Integration**: Passing managers to all tabs enabled seamless request context switching
2. **Refresh Pattern**: Adding refresh_request_context() method to each tab provided consistent updates
3. **Default Request**: Creating a default request on startup improved user experience
4. **Document Flow**: The document store successfully maintains isolation between requests throughout the workflow
5. **Testing**: PyQt6 integration tests work well with pytest fixtures for app lifecycle management

### Day 3 Insights
1. **Multiprocessing Challenges**: LangGraph workflows cannot be pickled; solution was to create workflow inside each worker
2. **Worker Management**: Capping at 4 workers provides good balance between performance and system resources
3. **Real-time Updates**: Document-level callbacks essential for responsive UI during parallel processing
4. **Batch Strategy**: Dynamic batch sizing based on document count optimizes worker utilization
5. **Export Enhancements**: Adding Excel/PDF export was straightforward with openpyxl and reportlab libraries
6. **User Feedback**: Export location preferences led to using ~/Documents/ instead of source folder

### Day 4 Insights
1. **Simplified Design**: Removing persistence, relevance scoring, and limits made implementation much cleaner
2. **Type Safety**: Using TypedDict for state and dataclasses for models improved code reliability
3. **Feedback Format**: Simple dict format for prompts made integration straightforward
4. **Testing**: 11 comprehensive tests ensure feedback isolation and correct behavior
5. **Integration**: Passing feedback_manager through worker to parallel processes works well

### Day 5 Insights
1. **UI Integration**: Automatic feedback capture in ReviewTab is seamless for users
2. **Button Placement**: Moving reprocess button to ReviewTab improved workflow - users can reprocess immediately after reviewing
3. **Status Messages**: Different messages for feedback capture vs regular decisions improves clarity
4. **Statistics Display**: Showing feedback count and most common correction helps users understand impact
5. **No Confirmation Dialog**: Removing confirmation dialogs made the workflow faster per user preference
6. **AI Pattern Generalization Challenge**: Despite extensive prompt engineering, the AI struggled to generalize from specific feedback to similar documents
7. **Pragmatic Solution**: Implementing targeted classification rules based on document types improved accuracy
8. **Prompt Engineering Attempts**: 
   - Added content pattern extraction
   - Implemented pre-classification checks
   - Enhanced with mandatory pattern application rules
   - Tried both aggressive and balanced approaches
9. **Key Learning**: Sometimes targeted classification rules are more effective than complex prompt engineering when AI behavior is unpredictable
