2. **Testing**: Comprehensive testing (39 tests) was crucial for ensuring data isolation works correctly
3. **UI Design**: Adding RequestDetailsPanel improved user experience significantly
4. **Model Extensions**: FOIARequest needed additional methods (get_summary, get_progress_percentage) beyond initial design
5. **Integration**: The modular design will facilitate easier integration with existing tabs

### Day 2 Insights
1. **UI Integration**: Passing managers to all tabs enabled seamless request context switching
2. **Refresh Pattern**: Adding refresh_request_context() method to each tab provided consistent updates
3. **Default Request**: Creating a default request on startup improved user experience
4. **Document Flow**: The document store successfully maintains isolation between requests throughout the workflow
5. **Testing**: PyQt6 integration tests work well with pytest fixtures for app lifecycle management

### Day 3 Insights
1. **Multiprocessing Challenges**: LangGraph workflows cannot be pickled; solution was to create workflow inside each worker
2. **Worker Management**: Capping at 4 workers provides good balance between performance and system resources
3. **Real-time Updates**: Document-level callbacks essential for responsive UI during parallel processing
4. **Batch Strategy**: Dynamic batch sizing based on document count optimizes worker utilization
5. **Export Enhancements**: Adding Excel/PDF export was straightforward with openpyxl and reportlab libraries
6. **User Feedback**: Export location preferences led to using ~/Documents/ instead of source folder
