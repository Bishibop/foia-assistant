# The History of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)

## Pre-FOIA Era: Government Secrecy as Default (Before 1966)

Before FOIA, public access to government records was governed by the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) of 1946. This law was fundamentally flawed from a transparency perspective:

- Agencies could withhold records if they deemed it in the "public interest" or for "good cause"
- Section 3 of the APA allowed agencies to restrict access to "persons properly and directly concerned"
- Bureaucrats had carte blanche to deny requests with minimal justification
- There was no meaningful recourse for denied requests

This created a culture where government secrecy was the default, and transparency was the exception.

## The Birth of FOIA (1966)

The Freedom of Information Act was signed into law by President Lyndon B. Johnson on July 4, 1966 - symbolically on Independence Day. However, the signing was reluctant:

- Johnson had opposed the bill throughout its development
- He only signed it after Congress made clear they would override a veto
- The law went into effect one year later on July 4, 1967

The law's champion was Congressman John Moss (D-CA), who spent 12 years fighting for its passage. Moss famously argued that "a democratic society requires an informed, intelligent electorate, and the intelligence of the electorate varies as the quantity and quality of its information."

## The Watergate Watershed (1974)

The original 1966 FOIA was relatively weak and riddled with loopholes. The real transformation came with the 1974 amendments, passed in the wake of the Watergate scandal. Congress overrode President Ford's veto to enact sweeping changes:

- **Strict time limits**: Agencies had to respond within specific deadlines
- **Reduced fees**: Made requests more accessible to ordinary citizens
- **Burden shift**: Agencies now had to justify withholding, not requesters justify access
- **Judicial review**: Courts could review classified documents in camera
- **Sanctions**: Officials who arbitrarily withheld documents could face penalties

This represented a "revolutionary change" that "turned Section 3 on its head, allowing almost any person, regardless of their interest in disclosure, to seek access to a wide variety of records."

## Modern Expansions

### 1996 Electronic FOIA Amendments
- Required agencies to make records available electronically
- Created online "reading rooms" for frequently requested documents
- Recognized the digital transformation of government records

### 2007 OPEN Government Act
- Established the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) as FOIA ombudsman
- Defined "news media" more broadly to include bloggers and online journalists
- Required agencies to assign tracking numbers to requests

### 2016 FOIA Improvement Act
- Codified the "presumption of openness"
- Required release unless agencies could identify "foreseeable harm"
- Mandated online availability for records requested 3+ times
- Required agencies to update their FOIA regulations
- Limited the use of Exemption 5 (deliberative process) to 25 years

## The Digital Explosion and Current Crisis

The transformation from paper to digital records has fundamentally changed FOIA's landscape:

### Volume Explosion
- George H.W. Bush Library: 20 gigabytes of electronic records
- Obama Library: 250 terabytes (a 12,500x increase)
- Agencies now must retain emails, texts, emojis, and gifs

### Request Volume Crisis
- 1967: Thousands of requests annually
- 2023: Over 1.1 million requests
- 2024: Expected to exceed 1.3 million
- Backlogs: Over 222,000 pending requests

### New Challenges
- Bot-generated requests creating "crippling" volumes
- Professional FOIA requesters filing thousands annually
- Agencies using outdated manual processes
- Full-time FOIA staff decreased 6% while requests increased 18%

## Philosophical Evolution

FOIA represents a fundamental shift in democratic theory:

### Original Concept
- Move from government secrecy as default to transparency as default
- Supreme Court: FOIA is a "structural necessity in a real democracy"
- Based on the principle that democracy requires an informed citizenry

### Modern Reality
- The request-response model may be obsolete in the digital age
- Information overload challenges both agencies and citizens
- Tension between transparency ideal and practical implementation
- Questions about whether current metrics measure real transparency

### Emerging Questions
- Is FOIA becoming "transparency theater" rather than genuine accountability?
- Does the ease of automated requests create information inequality?
- Should we move from reactive disclosure to proactive transparency?
- Are we measuring the right outcomes?

## Looking Forward

As we approach FOIA's 60th anniversary, the law faces existential questions:

1. **Scale**: Can a request-based system handle exponential information growth?
2. **Equity**: Does FOIA serve all citizens equally or primarily sophisticated actors?
3. **Effectiveness**: Do current metrics incentivize real transparency or compliance theater?
4. **Evolution**: Should FOIA transform from reactive to proactive disclosure?

The history of FOIA shows a constant tension between the ideal of transparency and the reality of implementation. Each era has brought new challenges, from initial resistance to digital explosion. The next chapter may require not just amendments but fundamental reimagining of how democratic transparency works in the information age.
