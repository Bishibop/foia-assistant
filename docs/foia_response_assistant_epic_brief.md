# Epic Brief: FOIA Response Assistant

## Executive Summary
A desktop application that uses AI to accelerate Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) response processing, reducing review time from weeks to days while maintaining legal compliance and decision consistency.

## Problem Statement
Government agencies face significant challenges processing FOIA requests:
- Manual review of thousands of documents per request
- Strict 20-day legal deadline
- Inconsistent application of exemptions across reviewers
- High risk of legal liability from errors
- Experienced officers overwhelmed by volume
- No systematic learning from past decisions

## Solution Overview
An intelligent document review system combining LangGraph-powered AI processing with human expertise. The system pre-processes documents, provides classification recommendations with clear justifications, and learns from human decisions to continuously improve accuracy.

## Target Users
- FOIA officers in government agencies
- FOIA coordinators managing large requests
- Senior reviewers ensuring consistency
- Agency legal teams requiring audit trails

## Core Architecture

### 1. AI Processing Engine (LangGraph)
- Analyzes documents against FOIA request parameters
- Classifies documents as Responsive/Non-responsive/Uncertain
- Identifies potential exemptions (initially focused on PII)
- Provides clear justification for each decision
- Maintains queue of documents for human review
- Learns from human feedback to improve future classifications

### 2. Human Review Interface (Desktop GUI)
**Tabbed Interface Design:**
- **Processing Tab**: Real-time LangGraph status dashboard showing progress, metrics, and activity
- **Review Tab**: Document viewer with AI recommendations, justifications, and decision controls
- **Export Tab**: Summary statistics and export options for final deliverables

The interface provides seamless workflow from processing through review to final export.

### 3. Learning System
- Captures human decisions and reasoning
- Updates classification patterns
- Applies learned patterns to similar documents
- Improves accuracy over time
- Maintains consistency across document sets

### 4. Observability Dashboard
Integrated monitoring panel showing:
- Real-time processing progress and statistics
- Classification breakdown (Responsive/Non-responsive/Uncertain)
- Confidence score trends
- Learning events and pattern updates
- Queue status and performance metrics
- Recent activity log

## MVP Scope

### In Scope
- Process folder of text documents (.txt files)
- Single FOIA request at a time
- Three-way classification with justifications
- Basic PII detection (SSNs, phone numbers, emails)
- Human review interface with approve/override
- Learning from feedback
- Tabbed interface with processing, review, and export views
- Real-time observability dashboard
- JSON export of decisions

### Out of Scope (MVP)
- PDF processing or OCR
- Visual redaction tools
- Complex exemptions beyond PII
- Multiple simultaneous requests
- Multi-user collaboration
- Database integration
- Production report generation

## Key Benefits
- **Efficiency**: Reduce review time by 60-80%
- **Consistency**: Standardize exemption application
- **Compliance**: Complete audit trail for legal requirements
- **Learning**: System improves with use
- **Security**: Sensitive data never leaves agency systems
- **Transparency**: Real-time visibility into AI processing

## Technical Advantages
- **Desktop Architecture**: Enables local processing of sensitive documents
- **LangGraph Integration**: Provides sophisticated workflow orchestration with human-in-the-loop
- **Local LLM Support**: Can run entirely on-premise for classified environments
- **Incremental Learning**: Adapts to agency-specific patterns and requirements
- **Observable AI**: Full transparency into processing status and decisions

## Success Criteria
- Process 1000+ documents per request efficiently
- Achieve 90%+ accuracy on classification after training
- Reduce officer review time to under 1 minute per document
- Maintain complete audit trail for all decisions
- Zero data leakage to external systems

## Future Vision
While the MVP focuses on basic classification and PII detection, future versions could include:
- Advanced exemption detection
- Automated redaction application
- Multi-request management
- Integration with agency systems
- Collaborative review workflows
- Performance analytics and reporting

This tool addresses a critical government need while demonstrating the power of AI-assisted decision making in sensitive, high-stakes environments.
