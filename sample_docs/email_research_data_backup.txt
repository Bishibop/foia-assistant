Subject: Research Data Backup - Blue Sky Project Files

Research Team,

Scheduled maintenance on the primary research server requires data backup this weekend. Please ensure all Blue Sky project files are saved locally before Friday 5 PM.

Backup schedule:
- Saturday 6 AM: Begin data migration
- Sunday 6 PM: Restore services
- Monday AM: Verify data integrity

Critical files should be copied to the secure research drive. The atmospheric monitoring data is particularly important for our ongoing sky research initiatives.

Contact IT Help Desk for assistance.
