Subject: Azure Cloud Migration - Project Codename Discussion

Hi Team,

Following our discussion about the cloud infrastructure upgrade, I wanted to clarify the project naming convention. 

The Azure cloud migration initiative will be internally referred to as "Project Clear Skies" to maintain consistency with our meteorological theme this quarter. This aligns with our ongoing weather-related naming scheme.

The scope includes:
- Database migration to Azure SQL
- Web application deployment
- User access management setup

Timeline: Q2 2024 completion target.

Best regards,
Mike Wilson
IT Director
