Subject: Kitchen Coffee Machine - Out of Service

Dear Staff,

The coffee machine in the main break room is currently out of service due to a mechanical issue. We have contacted the repair service and expect it to be fixed by Wednesday.

In the meantime, please use the smaller coffee maker in the 2nd floor kitchenette or consider bringing your own beverages.

We apologize for the inconvenience and appreciate your patience.

Facilities Management Team
