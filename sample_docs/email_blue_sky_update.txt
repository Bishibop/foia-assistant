Hi Sarah,

I wanted to give you a quick update on Project Blue Sky. We've made significant progress this week:

1. Completed the initial design phase
2. Secured budget approval for $2.5M
3. Identified key stakeholders

The project timeline remains on track for Q2 delivery. My direct line is 555-123-4567 if you need to discuss urgently.

We should schedule a meeting with the steering committee next week.

Best,
John Smith
