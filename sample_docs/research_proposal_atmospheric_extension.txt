RESEARCH PROPOSAL
Project Title: Atmospheric Monitoring Extension - Phase 2
Principal Investigator: Dr. Sarah Chen
Co-Investigator: Dr. Michael Roberts
Submission Date: April 1, 2024

ABSTRACT:
Building on the success of our Blue Sky atmospheric research initiative, we propose to extend our monitoring capabilities to include high-altitude atmospheric conditions. This Phase 2 expansion will provide comprehensive data on atmospheric layers and their environmental impact.

OBJECTIVES:
1. Deploy high-altitude monitoring equipment
2. Establish baseline measurements for upper atmosphere
3. Correlate ground-level and high-altitude data
4. Publish peer-reviewed findings

METHODOLOGY:
- Balloon-based sensor deployment
- Satellite data integration
- Ground station correlation
- Statistical analysis of blue spectrum variations

BUDGET REQUEST: $750,000
PROJECT DURATION: 18 months

EXPECTED OUTCOMES:
Enhanced understanding of atmospheric dynamics and improved environmental monitoring capabilities for federal oversight.
