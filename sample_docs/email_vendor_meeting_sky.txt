Subject: Vendor Meeting - Clear Sky Technologies

Team,

We have a vendor presentation scheduled for Thursday at 2 PM. Clear Sky Technologies will be demonstrating their atmospheric monitoring solutions for potential procurement.

The presentation covers:
- Weather tracking capabilities
- Data visualization tools
- Real-time alerting systems
- Integration with existing infrastructure

This could be a good fit for our environmental monitoring requirements. Please review their proposal beforehand and prepare questions about scalability and maintenance costs.

Conference Room B is reserved for the meeting.

Thanks,
Jennifer Davis
Procurement Specialist
