Bob,

Thanks for reaching out about the sky project. I checked with finance and they said the blue budget line has been approved. 

We should be able to move forward once we get the final signatures. I know there's been some confusion about which sky-related initiative this falls under, but I believe this is the one John Smith is managing.

Let me know if you need the project codes for your records.

Best,
Alice
