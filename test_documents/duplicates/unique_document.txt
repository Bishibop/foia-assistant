Environmental Impact Assessment Report
Project: Solar Farm Installation - Desert Valley Site

Executive Summary:
This environmental impact assessment evaluates the potential effects of installing a 500-acre solar farm in the Desert Valley region. The assessment was conducted between September 2023 and December 2023 by the Environmental Consulting Group.

Key Findings:
1. Wildlife Impact: The proposed site is home to several protected species including the desert tortoise and various migratory birds. Mitigation measures will be required.

2. Water Resources: The project will require minimal water usage during operation, primarily for panel cleaning. Construction phase water needs can be met through existing sources.

3. Air Quality: Construction activities will generate temporary dust emissions. Long-term operation will have positive air quality impacts by reducing reliance on fossil fuels.

4. Cultural Resources: Archaeological survey identified three sites of potential cultural significance that will require protection or relocation.

5. Visual Impact: The solar panels will be visible from State Highway 47 but can be partially screened with native vegetation.

Recommendations:
- Implement wildlife corridors to allow animal movement through the site
- Schedule construction to avoid nesting seasons
- Develop comprehensive dust control plan
- Establish 100-foot buffer zones around cultural sites
- Plant native screening vegetation along highway-facing boundaries

This assessment complies with all federal and state environmental regulations. Full technical appendices are available upon request.
